    <p class="text-center">&nbsp;Ever since meeting each other in their middle school yearbook class, both Taysia and
      Courtney have become inseparable and live their days with each other to the fullest. As a Web
      Development major and the other a biology major, they use their platform as a way to destress
      and have a little fun in the chaos that is known as college. Their interests include astrology, love,
      fun, and impulsive decisions (as you will see throughout the podcast). They together live by the
      motto “ Yolo” and will encourage their viewers to do the same.</p>

	Hey everyone, my name is Courtney and I am 19, and born and raised in North Carolina. I am super excited to be part of this podcast and can't wait to share my thoughts and experiences with all of you. Growing up in the South has definitely influenced who I am today, but I like to think that I have a unique perspective on things. I am currently a college student studying biology, and in my free time, I love to read, listen to music, and party ofc. I am also a huge fan of all things true crime and can't resist a good mystery. I'm looking forward to sharing my thoughts on a wide range of topics and hope to connect with all of you through our conversations!

	 Hi guys! I'm Taysia. When I'm not busy pretending to be in a rom-com, you can catch me binge-watching my favorite movies or listening to my crazily long playlists. And let's not forget my obsession with love, which is probably why I'm still single, but hey, a girl can dream, right? Anyway, I'm excited to be a part of this podcast and share my delusional, I mean, unique perspective on all things entertainment and romance. So buckle up and get ready for a wild ride!
